========================
Interactive Radial Chart
========================

A simple demonstration of using D3's partition layout to interactively build
a sunburst/radial chart.

You can view it in action here: http://kevindias.com/projects/radial/

Bug reports or suggestions for improvement can be submitted to the Bitbucket
repo: https://bitbucket.org/dias.kev/radial-chart-demo/

The demo has been kept as a single HTML file to make it easy to download and
run locally if you aren't using Internet Explorer (which needs an extra script
for the export function).
